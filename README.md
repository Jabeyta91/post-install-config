To begin post installation as a administrator I began to define the roles for agaents per department. By giving people who have "Supreme Admin" roles permissions to create and delete tickets. This can be done by clicking Admin Panel -> Agents -> Roles. Since tickets are routed through different departments within a help desk there are many settings per department. To create a department for an assignment you can access it by clicking Admin Panel -> Agents -> Departments.

Next step is creating teams as for instance the best technicians from each department to form a team to handle specific issues. Consisting of level 1 or level 2 for instance support agents. As a administrator I can assign each agent different departments and roles.
